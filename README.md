# About Legemdary-Train

The goal of this app was to create a space where people could easily list items they'd have availible at their yard sale, so people could see if it's worth going to for what they want.  This way, if you were putting up posters about your yard sale, you could also include an easy URL for people to visit ahead of time.

This is also a demonstration of creating an app with CRUD funtionality, creating document relationships in the database, and utilizing these relationships to selectively display content and functionality.  When a user is logged in for instance, they can view every yard sale, but their postings are tied to their user ID, and only they have the functionality to update or delete items associated with their user ID.  

# to-do/wish list:

- Add a name!
- Create an image upload form, and store those images on the server for both profile picture and item pictures.
- Make the list of yard sales searchable by name
- Make the list of yard sales filterable by distance from the logged in users address
- Add a QR code, either for the site in general, or generate ones that direct people to specific users catalogs.
- UPDATE functionality for the user information
- Improve the layout.  Specifically I'd like the cards in the catalog to arrange more like Instagram
- To that end, possible re-style the cards so just the picture shows, and then on hover the item details show overlayed.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
